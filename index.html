            InkyBlackness is a pet-project for experimentation. Any useful by-products are happily created,
            and not the main goal otherwise. The problem domain is the old DOS game
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock">System Shock</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, while it is explicitly <em>not</em> the main goal to create another attempt at a clone, work is
            performed under the following assumption: &quot;What would one need if they wanted to make a clone?&quot;
            And follow the resulting things in small steps.
         </p>

         <h2>Current Focus</h2>
         <p>
            The current focus is on the data files and the capability to properly load and save them. Instead of
            slowly implementing a game engine on the go to represent properties of the resources, the smallest
            possible steps are performed to see changes using the one engine that runs stable for over 20 years now.
         </p>

         <h2>Resources</h2>
         <p>
            The most relevant sub-project is <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/ss-specs">ss-specs</a>, the
            documentation of the data files. This project, with the help of the other supporting sub-projects, is set up
            to allow easy contribution on any finding.
         </p>
         <p>
            The regularly released software-package is <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/deck">deck</a>, which
            contains the pre-built binaries of a collection of tools.
         </p>
         <p>
            The 2D level-editor is currently realized with &quot;shocked-client&quot;. Its user documentation can be
            found <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/shocked-client/wiki">here</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/hacker">hacker</a> is a command-line tool with which
            modifications can be performed on the byte-level. It is meant to allow rapid experimentation with
            changes on the data files. Results of these experiments should flow back into ss-specs.
         </p>
         <p>
            A dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxEhgHRGd6WLEUEw8vnHm2Q">YouTube channel</a> exists,
            with tutorials and show-cases of modding.
