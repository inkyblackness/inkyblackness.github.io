            InkyBlackness is an open-source project for creating modding tools for System Shock (1994).
            Any useful by-products are happily created, and not the main goal otherwise.
            The problem domain is the old DOS game
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock">System Shock (1994)</a>.
         </p>

         <h2>Current Focus</h2>
         <p>
            The current focus is on creating a fully capable data, resource, and level editor for the game.
            It is meant to create compatible files for both the vanilla game, as well as the re-releases, such as
            the extended edition (SS:EE), and the "source-port" including compatible derivatives.
         </p>
         <p>
            The related sub-project is <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/ss-specs">ss-specs</a>, the
            documentation of the data files. This project, with the help of the other supporting sub-projects, is set up
            to allow easy contribution on any finding.
         </p>

         <h2>Releases</h2>
         <h3>HackEd</h3>
         <p>
            This graphical editor is meant to become the all-in-one editor for the game. The related sub-project is
            <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/hacked">here</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            At the moment (2018-06), this tool is not ready to obsolete the deck package. See below.
         </p>
         <h3>Deck package</h3>
         <p>
            The software-package called <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/deck">deck</a> contains the
            pre-built binaries of a collection of tools.
            Follow the official forum thread about this package <a href="https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=9515.0">on the systemshock.org forums</a>.
            For the moment, this is the complete package of &quot;prototype&quot; tools, which still allow a decent amount of
            editing. Yet, they are meant to be superseded by HackEd.
         </p>
         <p>
            The 2D level-editor is currently realized with &quot;shocked-client&quot;. Its user documentation can be
            found <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/shocked-client/wiki">here</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/inkyblackness/hacker">hacker</a> is a command-line tool with which
            modifications can be performed on the byte-level. It is meant to allow rapid experimentation with
            changes on the data files. Results of these experiments should flow back into ss-specs.
         </p>

         <h3>Resources</h3>
         <p>
            A dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxEhgHRGd6WLEUEw8vnHm2Q">YouTube channel</a> exists,
            with tutorials and show-cases of modding.
